The HTML defines the structure of the football field, and the CSS styles it to resemble a soccer field. Here's a breakdown of what my code does:

HTML:


The HTML file defines a football game interface.
It includes a start button with the start-button class, a score box with the score-box class, and a soccer field container with the container class.
The soccer field container contains various elements that represent different parts of a soccer field, like lines, penalty areas, goals, and center circle.


CSS:

The CSS file provides styling to create the visual representation of the football field.
It sets the background color of the body to a semi-transparent green color.
The .container class styles the soccer field container, giving it dimensions, background color, border radius, and positioning.
Different elements within the container are styled to create the visual components of the soccer field, such as lines, penalty areas, goals, center circle, and center spot.
The .start-button class styles the start button, setting its appearance, position, size, font, background color, border, and cursor. It also applies transitions and a text shadow for a visual effect.
The .score-box and #score-text classes style the score box that displays the current score. The #score-box and #score-text IDs are used to hide the score box and score text initially.
The #soccer-field and #start-button IDs are used to control the visibility of the soccer field container and start button.


JavaScript:


The JavaScript code in the <script> tags is responsible for showing the soccer field and score box when the start button is clicked.
Overall, your project is a creative use of HTML and CSS to create a visual representation of a football field. It demonstrates how styling can be used to build interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.
