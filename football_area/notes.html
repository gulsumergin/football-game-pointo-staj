  In the context of CSS (cascading style sheets), the position property is used to specify how an element is positioned within its parent container.
  There are several values that can be assigned to the position property, and one of them is absolute. When an element's position is set to absolute, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the document's initial containing block if there is no positioned ancestor).

  Here's a breakdown of what position: absolute does:
  The element is removed from the normal flow: When an element has an absolute position, it is no longer part of the regular document flow. This means that other elements will ignore its space and position.

h2 {
  position: absolute;
  left: 100px;
  top: 150px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>The position Property</h1>

<h2>This is a heading with an absolute position</h2>

<p>With absolute positioning, an element can be placed anywhere on a page. The heading below is placed 100px from the left of the page and 150px from the top of the page.</p>

  In the case of your example code, the .start-button class has its position set to absolute. This means that the element with the class .start-button will be positioned absolutely within its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.



  The transform: translate(-50%, -50%); CSS declaration is used to center an element both horizontally and vertically within its parent container. It is often used in combination with position: absolute to achieve this centering effect.
